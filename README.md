This project has been my first contact with the world of video game development, this GameJam competition organized by School 42 Madrid and the Madrid in Game initiative has been a unique opportunity that as a programmer I would not have imagined.

# Description
"Take or Deal" is an exciting turn-based strategy game where two telecom companies compete fiercely to seize critical communication nodes. Each company must use smart tactics and a little luck to gain control of as many nodes as possible.

# Objective of the game
The objective of the game is to be the company with the most communication nodes under control at the end of the game. To achieve this, players must draw cards from a deck that can positively or negatively affect their control of nodes.

#### Shift Structure:

On each turn, a player can perform the take action on the terminal.
The take action allows the player to take a random card from the deck.

#### The deck:
The deck consists of 12 cards, divided equally into positive and negative:

#### 6 positive cards:
- 2 +1 node cards.
- 2 cards of +2 nodes.
- 1 card with +3 nodes.
- 1 card of +5 nodes.
#### 6 negative cards:
- 2 cards of -1 node.
- 2 cards of -2 nodes.
- 1 card of -3 nodes.
- 1 card of -5 nodes.

##### Card Effects:

When you draw a card, the card's effect is applied immediately.
Positive cards increase the number of nodes controlled by the player.
Negative cards decrease the number of nodes controlled by the player.

#### End of the game:

- The game continues until all the cards in the deck have been drawn.
- The player with the greatest number of nodes under his control at the end of the game is the winner.
